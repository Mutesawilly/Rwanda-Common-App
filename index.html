<!-- Your challenge is to create a platform where high school students and other applicants can easily apply to multiple Rwandan universities in one place. Universities will be able to register with the platform, post their application requirements, and receive applications. The platform will include:

Applicant Portal: Create a user-friendly interface for applicants to:

Register and log in.

Search for universities and their programs.

University Registration by Admin: To ensure credibility, only the platform’s admin will have the authority to register universities. This will prevent scams and ensure that only verified institutions participate.

University Profiles: Enable universities to:

Post application requirements, deadlines, and program details.

Admin Dashboard: Design an admin panel for universities to:

View, filter, and respond to applications.

Communicate with applicants when necessary.

Centralized Management: Ensure that all data is organized efficiently, making it easy for users to access and interact with the platform. -->
